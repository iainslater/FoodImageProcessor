Ingredients:
	•	250g digestive biscuits (crushed into chunks, not powder).
	•	160g unsalted butter (melted).
        50g dark chocolate for contents
	•	60g golden syrup.
	•	50g cocoa powder.
        80g sultantas
	•	150g milk chocolate (melted, for topping).
	•	50g dark chocolate (optional, mixed with milk chocolate for topping).

Method:
	1.	Prepare the Base:
	•	Break the digestive biscuits into small chunks (leave some larger pieces for texture).
	•	In a saucepan over low heat, melt the butter, golden syrup, dark choc and cocoa powder together until smooth.
	2.	Combine Ingredients:
	•	Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the crushed biscuits until they are evenly coated with the chocolate mixture.
	3.	Shape the Mixture:
	•	Press the biscuit mixture firmly into a lined square or rectangular baking tin (8x8 inch works well). Smooth the top with the back of a spoon.
	4.	Add the Chocolate Layer:
	•	Melt the milk chocolate (and dark chocolate if using) over a double boiler or in the microwave in short bursts. Pour this over the biscuit base, spreading evenly.
	5.	Set and Slice:
	•	Chill the bar in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or until firm.
	•	Once set, slice into bars or squares.
